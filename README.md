## Sample Application Using Gulp

This project was used for an [Automating Builds](http://www.sarahfrisk.com/slides/automating-builds.pdf) talk at the Portland Maine Web Developer's Group on March 14, 2016.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

[Node.js and npm](http://nodejs.org/download/) should be installed, [as well as `gulp`](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md).

### Building

Once you've cloned this sample application app to your machine, run these commands:
```bash
$ npm install
$ gulp watch
```

This will trigger the gulp watch task which includes CSS vendor prefixing, SASS compilation, and CSS minification.

Hope this helps!
